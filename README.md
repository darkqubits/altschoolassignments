This repo contains three assignments submitted to AltSchool Africa for first semester assesment.

# Assignment 1

A replica of the Alt School Africa application form, built purely using html. It is also linked to an about page, where I added a few notes about myself. The main goal of this is to practicalize all the knowledge we got from html classes. This assignment emphasized the importance of ensuring assessiblity in html.

# Assignment 2

This is a registration page the is built using html and css while ensuring mobile responsiveness.

# Assignment 3 

This is also built using html and css. Responsiveness is not a requirement, but encouraged.
