        Biography: I was born in Jimeta, Adamawa State. I went to FCE primary
        school, then went to University Secondary School, MAUTECH Yola. After
        that, I gained admission into ABU Zaria where I studied pharmacy. I was
        fascinated by computers since childhood, I had my first computer
        training in 2006. But due to lack of guidance, I was not able to
        continue in-depth learning. I current work in a healthcare technology
        company in a non-technical role, but I aspire to transition into a more
        technical role.
