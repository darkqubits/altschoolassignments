        I was born in Jimeta, Adamawa State. I went to FCE primary school, then
        went to University Secondary School, MAUTECH Yola. After that, I gained
        admission into ABU Zaria where I studied pharmacy. I was fascinated by
        computers since childhood, I had my first computer training in 2006. But
        due to lack of guidance, I was not able to continue in-depth learning. I
        current work in a healthcare technology company in a non-technical role,
        but I aspire to transition into a more technical role.
